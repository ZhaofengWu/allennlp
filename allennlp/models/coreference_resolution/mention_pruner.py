    """
    This `Model` implements the coreference resolution model described "End-to-end Neural
    Coreference Resolution"
    <https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/End-to-end-Neural-Coreference-Resolution-Lee-He/3f2114893dc44eacac951f148fbff142ca200e83>
    by Lee et al., 2017.
    The basic outline of this model is to get an embedded representation of each span in the
    document. These span representations are scored and used to prune away spans that are unlikely
    to occur in a coreference cluster. For the remaining spans, the model decides which antecedent
    span (if any) they are coreferent with. The resulting coreference links, after applying
    transitivity, imply a clustering of the spans in the document.

    # Parameters

    vocab : `Vocabulary`
    text_field_embedder : `TextFieldEmbedder`
        Used to embed the `text` `TextField` we get as input to the model.
    context_layer : `Seq2SeqEncoder`
        This layer incorporates contextual information for each word in the document.
    mention_feedforward : `FeedForward`
        This feedforward network is applied to the span representations which is then scored
        by a linear layer.
    antecedent_feedforward : `FeedForward`
        This feedforward network is applied to pairs of span representation, along with any
        pairwise features, which is then scored by a linear layer.
    feature_size : `int`
        The embedding size for all the embedded features, such as distances or span widths.
    max_span_width : `int`
        The maximum width of candidate spans.
    spans_per_word: float, required.
        A multiplier between zero and one which controls what percentage of candidate mention
        spans we retain with respect to the number of words in the document.
    max_antecedents: int, required.
        For each mention which survives the pruning stage, we consider this many antecedents.
    lexical_dropout : `int`
        The probability of dropping out dimensions of the embedded text.
    initializer : `InitializerApplicator`, optional (default=`InitializerApplicator()`)
        Used to initialize the model parameters.

            A metadata dictionary for each instance in the batch. We use the "original_text" and "clusters" keys
